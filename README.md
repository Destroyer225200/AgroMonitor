Smart Greenhouse Automation - Control Interface
A graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and controlling a smart greenhouse system.

Description
This project is the foundation of a smart greenhouse automation system. Currently, it features a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to allow users to interact with and control the system's future IoT-based functionalities. The interface serves as the control center for managing greenhouse parameters and monitoring real-time data.

The project aims to integrate IoT technologies to automate key processes like temperature regulation, humidity control, and lighting optimization in the greenhouse environment.
